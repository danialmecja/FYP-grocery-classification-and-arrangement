Located in grocery-vision is Danial's vision modules for the grocery detection and classification task. I plan on structuring this directory as follows:

- data folder with subfolders consisting of raw and processed images
- src folder with source code. 
	- Code includes data subfolder with scripts to download and prep data. 
	- Features subfolder with scripts to turn raw data into features for modelling.
	- Models subfolder with scripts to train YOLO model and making predictions.
	- Viz (maybe) to create visualizations of dataset and model.
